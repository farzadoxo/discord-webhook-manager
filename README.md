<h3>
  What is this?
</h3>
An application for sending and managing Discord messages through Webhook.
<h3>
  What is Webhook ?
</h3>
Discord's built in Webhooks function as an easy way to get automated messages and data updates sent to a text channel in your server.

Think of them as one of those fancy pneumatic tube things you used to love sending money into at a bank and watch disappear, but instead of never seeing your money again, you're actually sending messages into Discord from another platform.

By creating a webhook endpoint in your server, you'll generate a Webhook URL that you can drop into a number of different other services to link the two. [Learn More](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
